= `ChannelNoteCollector`

== Goal

In the previous step, you defined a `NOTE` data structure which contains all information that defines a note.
In order to visualize the music, we would like to have a nice list of `NOTE` objects.
However, while a MIDI file does indeed contain this information, it does so in a somewhat indirect manner: instead of a list of notes, it encodes them as note on and note off events.
It will therefore be necessary to find pairs of these events, each defining a single note.
An example of the correspondence between notes and events can be found in <<../../../background-information/midi.asciidoc#example,the MIDI background information>>.

It is important to know when a note on and note off event both form a pair.

* Both events need to take place on the same channel.
* Both events mention the same note.

A note also has an instrument associated with it.
Instruments are encoded as <<../../../background-information/midi.asciidoc#programchange,program change events>>.
This means that in order to reconstruct note data from midi events, you need to keep an eye on three types of events:

* Note on
* Note off
* Program change

Keeping track of notes and instruments on all channels simultaneously can become a bit complex.
We therefore choose to split up the code in separate classes.

* A `ChannelNoteCollector` will focus on a single channel `C` and (mostly) ignore events on other channels.
  It keeps track of instrument changes and notes.
* Because there are 16 different channels, we will also need 16 different ``ChannelNoteCollector``s, each responsible for collecting the notes on a particular channel.
* `read_mtrk` processes the MIDI file.
  Every time it finds an event, it informs the `EventReceiver` passed to it as parameter.
  However, now we have 16 such `EventReceiver`s (i.e. the 16 ``ChannelNoteCollector``s).
  We need a way of duplicating the event information to all 16 receivers.
  For this, we introduce the `EventMulticaster` class.
  Further details about this class will be given in a later step.

== `ChannelNoteCollector`

A `ChannelNoteCollector` derives from `EventReceiver`.
It receives all events but only actually cares about those on the "right" channel.
It keeps track of instrument changes (encoded as program change events) and forms notes based on note-on and note-off events.

[NOTE,caption={task-caption}]
====
* Start with creating the necessary files to accomodate the `ChannelNoteReceiver` class.
* Define `ChannelNoteReceiver` as a subclass of `EventReceiver`.
* `EventReceiver` has a number of "abstract" member functions which all need an implementation in `ChannelNoteReceiver`.
  For now, an empty body will do.
====

Say we send a `ChannelNoteCollector` the following events using the code below:

[source,c++]
----
// Assume collector listens to channel 4
collector.program_change(Duration(555), Channel(4), Instrument(9));
collector.note_on (Duration(0)  , Channel(4), NoteNumber(5), 127);
collector.note_off(Duration(100), Channel(4), NoteNumber(5), 0  );
----

The `collector` should produce a `NOTE` with

[%header,cols=">,<",width="30%"]
|===
| Field | Value
| `note_number` | 5
| `instrument` | 9
| `start` | 555
| `duration` | 100
| `velocity` | 127
|===

Make sure you understand all the details:

* The first event occurs only after 555 time units, which impacts all following events.
  This explains why the note starts at 555.
* The duration of the note corresponds to the difference in time between the note on and note off events, that is, 100 time units.
* The instrument is determined by the program change event which takes place on the same channel as the note on/off events.
* The note number and velocity come from the note on/off events.

The default instrument is `0`, so if no `program_change` event occurred, `0` is the instrument that should be assigned to all subsequent notes.

Notes on the 'wrong' channel should be ignored:

[source,c++]
----
// Assume collector listens to channel 4
collector.note_on (Duration(0)  , Channel(4), NoteNumber(44), 70);
collector.note_on (Duration(0)  , Channel(5), NoteNumber(44), 80);
collector.note_off(Duration(100), Channel(5), NoteNumber(44), 0 );
collector.note_off(Duration(100), Channel(4), NoteNumber(44), 0 );
----

should produce one note:

[%header,cols=">,<",width="30%"]
|===
| Field | Value
| `note_number` | 44
| `instrument` | 0
| `start` | 0
| `duration` | 200
| `velocity` | 70
|===

IMPORTANT: Make sure you understand why the `duration` is `200`, not `100`.
Many students forget about taking into account the `delta_time` values of events on a different channel.

A `ChannelNoteCollector` should be initialized with a channel so that it knows which channel to keep an eye on.
In other words, the constructor should have a `Channel` parameter.

[NOTE,caption={task-caption}]
====
* Add a constructor to `ChannelNoteCollector`.
* Have it accept a `Channel`, which it stores in a field.

[#notereceiver]
=== Receiving Notes

Where does the collector send its `NOTE`s to?
We could have the collector store all the `NOTE`s in a `std::vector<NOTE>`, but that would be making assumptions:

* Maybe the user of the collector class want them in a `std::list<NOTE>`.
* Perhaps not store them at all put directly print them out.
* A MIDI file might contain a huge amount of notes that will not fit in memory.

So we need to ask ourselves the question, what should the `ChannelNoteCollector` do with these notes so as to maximize flexibility?

One way would be to introduce the concept of a note receiver, which could be defined as

[source,c++]
----
class NoteReceiver
{
public:
    virtual void receive_note(const NOTE&) = 0;
};
----

This could work, but puts the additional burden on the user of defining an extra class plus all complexity that goes with it.
For example, say we want the gather all ``NOTE``s in a vector, we would have to write

[source,c++]
----
class ToVector : public NoteReceiver
{
private:
    std::vector<NOTE>* vector;

public:
    ToVector(std::vector<NOTE>* vector) : vector(vector) { }

    void receive_note(const NOTE& note) override
    {
        vector->push_back(note);
    }
};

std::vector<NOTE> notes;
ToVector receiver(&notes);
ChannelNoteCollector collector(Channel(5), receiver);
----

We can shorten this dramatically by relying on <<../../../background-information/lambdas.asciidoc#,lambdas>>:

[source,c++]
----
std::vector<NOTE> notes;
ChannelNoteCollector collector(Channel(5),
                               [&notes](const NOTE& note) { notes.push_back(note); });
----

So, what does this mean for our `ChannelNoteCollector`?
Its constructor needs a second parameter: a function which it calls whenever a new note has been found
In our case, the function needs to accept a `const NOTE&` and return nothing:

[source,c++]
----
std::function<void(const NOTE&)> note_receiver
----

You can simply pass a function by value (no need to use references or pointers).

[NOTE,caption={task-caption}]
====
Add the second parameter to ``ChannelNoteCollector``'s constructor.
As usual, the constructor should store this parameter's value in a field.
====

=== Handling the Events

The only remaining thing to do is implement each event-handling member function.

* You are mostly interested in dealing with note on, note off and program change/
* Don't forget to check if the events take place on the correct channel.
* `note_on` should register the note's starting time and velocity.
* `note_on` should check the velocity: if it is <<../../../background-information/midi.asciidoc#noteonzerovelocity,zero>>, you should interpret it as a note off event.
* `note_off` should look up the information stored by note_on and create a `NOTE`.
* Make sure to keep it efficient.
  Store the data in the right data structure.
  No loops are necessary: it is just a matter of looking up the information in the right place.
* Don't forget to deal with the other events appropriately!
  The corresponding member functions definitely should *not* be empty.
