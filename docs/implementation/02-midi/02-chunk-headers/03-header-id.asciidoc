= `header_id`

`CHUNK_HEADER` contains the `id` as a `char[4]`.
This is not easy to work with.
We would prefer to be able to get the `id` as a `std::string`.

[NOTE,caption={task-caption}]
====
Write a function `header_id` that, given a `CHUNK_HEADER`, extracts the id and returns it as a string.
====

TIP: This requires only one line of code.
Look for the
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/string/[constructor] that
allows you to create a `std::string` from a `char` array. Also remember that
arrays are actually just pointers.
