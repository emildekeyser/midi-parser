= Report

Edit the file `report.json`. The file should contain valid json and contain the following information:

* `github-url`: refers to your GitHub repository. It should start with `https://` (which is the default), not with `git@` (if you communicate with GitHub through SSH).
* `first-name`: your first name, preferably without accents.
* `last-name`: your last name, preferably without accents.
* `student-id`: your r-number.
* `end-result`: optional. Remove it if you have no end result to share, i.e., don't leave in the TODO.

To check the validity of your `report.json`, run the provided `check-report.py` script:

[source,bash]
----
$ python check-report.py report.json
----

Only submit a report for which the checking script prints out a clear success message.
Since I rely on scripts to parse your reports, failure to send in a valid report might lead to an NA.
